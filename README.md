## Getting Started

For local usage:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/writing-tracker.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Start the server:** `npm start`
4. **Access the app:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

No login required. Data will disappear if you clear your browser cache though, as that's where the user identification is stored.

I think usage is relatively straightforward/intuitive, let me know if there are any questions.

## Acknowledgements
I found the following resources very helpful during building this process:

(1) I used Cursor for the first time while building this and really liked it.

(2) I used SQLite3 for the first time, and learned a lot from this tutorial: https://bytemyke.com/how-to-use-sqlite-in-node-js/
